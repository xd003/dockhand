/**
 * backups/discovery-core.ts — the PURE logic that turns a set of container
 * mounts into the volume binds + names a backup will capture. No docker, no DB,
 * so it is unit-testable directly; the docker-calling orchestration lives in
 * ./docker.
 *
 * A backup mounts each volume/bind READ-ONLY into the helper at `/volumes/<key>`
 * and runs `restic backup /volumes/`. This module decides the `<key>` and the
 * bind string for each mount, and reports anything it can't back up.
 *
 * Only `volume` and `bind` mounts are backed up. tmpfs / npipe / cluster and any
 * future mount type are SKIPPED (reported, not silently dropped) — a backup that
 * quietly omits data is exactly the failure mode we refuse.
