/**
 * backups/operations.ts — the operation record: the durable, user-visible
 * lifecycle of one backup or restore, stored in the shared schedule_executions
 * table. This is the observability + result model: the UI and automation read
 * these rows to know what happened.
 *
 * A record opens as `running`, streams throttled progress + log lines, and
 * closes exactly once with a terminal status DERIVED IN ONE PLACE (see
 * ./operations-core). The startup scrub rewrites any row left `running` by a
 * dead process to `failed`, so an interrupted operation is always resolvable
 * without a transaction — "running at boot" is unambiguously not-completed.
 *
 * The pure decision logic (terminal-status derivation, progress throttle) lives
 * in ./operations-core and is unit-tested there; this module is the thin
 * DB-bound wrapper.
