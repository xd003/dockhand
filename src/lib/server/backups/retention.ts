/**
 * backups/retention.ts - pure retention planning.
 *
 * Retention decides which snapshots restic keeps and which it forgets. Two
 * safety properties matter and both live here as pure functions:
 *
 *  1. SAFE DEFAULT: retention is OFF unless explicitly configured. A brand-new
 *     backup config keeps every snapshot forever until the user opts in, so a
 *     misconfiguration can never silently start deleting backups.
 *
 *  2. NEVER WIPE EVERYTHING: before a real prune, restic is run once with
 *     `--dry-run` and the plan is parsed. If the configured policy would delete
 *     EVERY snapshot in the group (keep = 0), the prune is refused. A policy
 *     that keeps nothing is always a mistake, not an intent.
 *
 * The policy is a discriminated union so contradictory settings are
 * unrepresentable - you cannot ask for "keep last 5" and "keep 6 monthly" at
 * once; you pick one mode.
 */
