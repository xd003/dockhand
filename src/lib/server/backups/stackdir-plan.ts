 *
 * MAIN FLOW: the backup helper bind-mounts the stack folder from the TARGET env's HOST at
 * /volumes/__dockhand_stackdir__:ro, and restic reads it from disk - the helper is a sibling
 * container on the target daemon, so a host path on that daemon is mountable. The snapshot
 * reflects the stack folder AS IT IS ON THE HOST (what the user actually edits).
 *
 * Direct-remote deployments without a host-side stack directory may use stdin
 * and leave no real Compose folder on that host. They fail explicitly instead
 * of claiming to have captured files from Dockhand's unrelated local copy.
 *
 * This module resolves the CANDIDATE host path (see resolveHostStackDir). A runtime probe
 * (helper bind + `test -f <composeFile>`) then proves the path is real on the target daemon
 * before capture; if it isn't (e.g. a direct env whose working_dir is Dockhand's own
 * /app/data path, not the host's), capture HARD-FAILS to data-only rather than silently
 * backing up an empty auto-created dir.
