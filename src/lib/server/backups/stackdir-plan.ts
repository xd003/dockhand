 * stackdir-plan.ts — the ONE place that decides WHICH host folder is captured as a
 * stack's directory. Pure and import-light (no db/docker/fs), so it is unit-testable
 * directly and can't drift into scattered `connectionType` branches.
 *
 * MAIN FLOW: the backup helper bind-mounts the stack folder from the TARGET env's HOST at
 * /volumes/__dockhand_stackdir__:ro, and restic reads it from disk - the helper is a sibling
 * container on the target daemon, so a host path on that daemon is mountable. The snapshot
 * reflects the stack folder AS IT IS ON THE HOST (what the user actually edits).
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION - a direct-REMOTE env with NO remote_stacks_dir: nothing is staged on the host
 * (deploy went via stdin), so there is no host folder to mount. The caller then tars the
 * compose/config from Dockhand's OWN local copy into the SAME snapshot location instead of
 * hard-failing. This is the only case that doesn't reflect the host 1:1 - because the host has
 * nothing to reflect.
 *
 * This module resolves the CANDIDATE host path (see resolveHostStackDir). A runtime probe
 * (helper bind + `test -f <composeFile>`) then proves the path is real on the target daemon
 * before capture; if it isn't (e.g. a direct env whose working_dir is Dockhand's own
 * /app/data path, not the host's), capture HARD-FAILS to data-only rather than silently
 * backing up an empty auto-created dir.
