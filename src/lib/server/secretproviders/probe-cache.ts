/**
 * Short-lived cache for live provider probes.
 *
 * The stack editor probes the bound provider to classify a compose ${VAR} as
 * present ("IN VAULT") or missing. Without protection a busy editor page (debounced
 * keystrokes + the list auto-refresh) fires overlapping probes, and each one would
 * hit the provider: wasted 1Password/Vault API calls, and for the CLI providers a
 * burst of keepassxc-cli/bws spawns (each re-deriving the key). Two guards:
 *   - a ~30s result cache (KEY NAMES only, never values), and
 *   - single-flight: probes for the same (providerId, selector) that arrive while a
 *     call is already in flight share that one Promise instead of spawning their own.
