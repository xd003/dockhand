/**
 * Shared contract for secret providers.
 *
 * Dockhand is provider-agnostic about where secrets come from. A secret
 * provider knows how to authenticate against one backend (1Password, Infisical,
 * HashiCorp Vault, ...), and supports one or both resolution modes:
 *
 *   1. Reference interpolation — a variable's value is an inline reference in
 *      that backend's own syntax (e.g. 1Password's `op://vault/item/field`),
 *      which the provider replaces with the real secret. Detection of what
 *      counts as a reference is provider-specific (see `isReference`).
 *   2. Bulk pull — fetch every secret under a provider-defined selector (a
 *      1Password Environment id, an Infisical project/environment/path, a Vault
 *      kv path, ...) as a flat key/value map.
 *
 * Concrete providers live in sibling files and are registered in ./index.
 * Decrypted config (tokens, hosts) is passed in by the caller and never
 * persisted here — providers hold it only for the duration of a call.
