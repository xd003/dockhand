/**
 * Source guard: deployStack() must record the SAME secret set it redacts against.
 *
 * F4 makes `deployStack()` attach the resolved secret VALUES to its result so the
 * per-route stack_deploy recorder can redact them out of a stored deploy error
 * (deploy-run-record.ts -> RunRecorder.addSecrets -> redactLine). The single
 * production line that carries F4 is, in src/lib/server/stacks.ts:
 *
 *     result.resolvedSecrets = Object.values(secretVars);
 *
 * where `secretVars` is the post-`resolveProviderEnvVars` set that
 * `executeComposeCommand(...)` just redacted the streamed lines against. If that
 * one line is deleted, resolvedSecrets stays undefined and the recorder redacts
 * against nothing -- a provider-resolved secret in a thrown/returned deploy error
 * would be stored in cleartext. A code review demonstrated the gap by mutation:
 * deleting the line left the entire targeted suite green, because the two tests
 * that reference `resolvedSecrets` (git-stack-deploy-run-record.test.ts,
 * stack-compose-redeploy-run-record.test.ts) fake `deployStack` wholesale and
 * hand-set the field in their fixtures -- they prove the DOWNSTREAM wiring, never
 * that the real stacks.ts populates it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SOURCE GUARD AND NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST (empirically established,
 * not assumed):
 *   1. `tests/helpers/stacks-fake.ts` calls mock.module('$lib/server/stacks', ...)
 *      at import time, which -- per its own doc comment and Bun's single-process
 *      test model -- freezes that specifier's exports for the ENTIRE run. Two
 *      existing suites import it, so in a full `bun test` run `import { deployStack }`
 *      resolves to the fake dispatcher, never the real function. There is no
 *      per-file process isolation in Bun to escape this.
 *   2. Independently: pulling the real `$lib/server/stacks` into a test's import
 *      graph evaluates a module chain that instantiates `better-sqlite3`, which
 *      Bun does not support ("'better-sqlite3' is not yet supported in Bun") and
 *      crashes at load. Reproduced twice while investigating this fix.
 * Either blocker alone makes a real-`deployStack` behaviour test impossible here;
 * that is why the whole suite fakes deployStack and guards its internal invariants
 * at the source level (see deploy-stack-online.test.ts, stack-create-start-build-
 * options.test.ts). This guard follows that established pattern.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT PROVE (honest limits of source matching): it matches
 * TEXT, so it cannot prove `secretVars` is populated correctly at runtime (covered
 * by resolveProviderEnvVars' own tests and the redaction tests), and a matching
 * string inside a comment would satisfy it -- so comments are stripped before
 * matching. It proves only the wiring: the derivation of `secretVars`, its use as
 * the executeComposeCommand secret argument, and its assignment to resolvedSecrets.
